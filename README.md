# Titanic-Dataset
This project predicts Titanic passenger survival using machine learning. After cleaning and analyzing the dataset, features like age, gender, and class were engineered. Models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were trained and evaluated to demonstrate classification on structured data.
